# first two lines are generated by ~/nk/Dev/bin/.generate_path
# 1st line : paths to add in PATH at initial login shell (profile)
# 2nd line : paths to update in PATH at each shell (rc files)
####################### Don't touch first two lines.
## Add paths to add in PATH
# Format:
#|p                   : profile only (will be excluded at each shell by rc files)
#|r                   : rc file only (will not be included at login shell)
#|b                   : in both (will persist at each shell. not exclude by rc files)
#|#                   : to comment
# use 'p' if needed to be excluded on each shell but remains at login shell
# other wise always use 'b' for paths to be initialized even at login shell.
# use 'r' to only include at each shell by rc files.
#|  path_to_file      : I don't know what will happen, anyways added to PATH
#|  path_to_directory : add to PATH (path can be relative to ~/nk/Dev/bin/)
# example :
# i/commented/this/dir/path
# another/dir/path
####################### Don't edit above lines. Insert paths from below (from 22nd line)
#r code
#r flutter
# .
# /tmp/bins
